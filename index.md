### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-kenneth-and-karina) 

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was my introduction to coding. We only had a program that printed out hello world, but it was really fun. As it was my first-time coding, it was difficult learning all these new steps in order to start the lab. In the end I was able to understand syntax and compiling as it is one of the more important topics.

* [Lab 3 Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-michael-and-karina/tree/main/part-2)

    Another favorite lab was lab 3 part-2. In this lab we created a program that converted a date to a Julian date and count how many days are between two Julian dates. This lab was difficult because we needed to include the Fliegal and Van Flandern equation which includes a lot of syntax. This was one of my favorites as I practiced how to write functions with as many as we did. Additionally, this lab was one of the first labs where there was both input and output from the user and the program. 

* [Lab 8 Part 1](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-karina-and-max/tree/main/part-1)

    Lastly, my third favorite is lab 8 part 1. In this lab we created a stitching pattern program through encapsulated loops. This was one of my favorites as it helped me get comfortable with the use of loops. I had issues with the pre- and post- incrementation of the pattern but this solidified knowledge on incrementation.It was challenging for a pattern output, but through tracing my code, I was able to resolve a comand line error that occurred.
